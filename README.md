### **Procedure:**

1. **Familiarization with AI Tools for Video Generation:**

   * **Runway Gen-2:** Converts text and images into dynamic videos; suitable for simple, quick results.
   * **Meta’s Make-A-Video:** Known for imaginative sequences and artistic interpretations.
   * **Google’s Imagen Video:** Generates high-resolution, detailed videos with excellent temporal and spatial coherence.

2. **Create a Simple Prompt:**

   A short and direct description to generate a basic scene.

   * **Prompt 1 (Simple):**
     *"A dinosaur walking in a forest"*

   This prompt was used in Runway Gen-2 and Make-A-Video to observe basic animation, environment understanding, and subject motion.

3. **Create a Detailed Prompt:**

   A descriptive prompt with more context, action, and setting.

   * **Prompt 2 (Detailed):**
     *"An ultra-detailed 4K cinematic video of a towering Tyrannosaurus rex walking across a misty valley at sunrise. Golden sunlight glows behind its silhouette, highlighting its scales. The camera performs a smooth dolly-in shot while small birds fly around. Slow, atmospheric music tone, hyper-real textures, film-grade color grading."*

   This prompt was run in Imagen Video and Make-A-Video to assess how well the model handles detailed instructions and renders natural scenery with realistic motion.

4. **Observation and Comparison:**

   * The **simple prompt** resulted in a short, general video with minimal background detail but correct subject behavior.
   * The **detailed prompt** produced a more visually rich scene with improved object placement, natural lighting, and coherent motion.
   * Imagen Video demonstrated better realism and clarity, whereas Make-A-Video showed creative animation with artistic color grading.

### **Prompting Techniques Overview:**

| Prompt Type     | Description                     | Tool Effectiveness                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple Prompt   | Short, direct descriptions      | Gen-2 (basic visuals), Make-A-Video (creative)      |
| Detailed Prompt | Richly descriptive with context | Imagen (high detail), Make-A-Video (creative depth) |

### **Optimization Strategies:**

* Use vivid and descriptive language for more coherent visuals.
* Choose the AI tool based on the desired output style (realistic vs. artistic).
* Observe differences between brief vs. richly descriptive inputs.
* Iterate based on model output to fine-tune prompt structure and wording.

### **Conclusion:**

The experiment successfully demonstrated that structured prompting plays a crucial role in the quality and style of AI-generated videos. The simple prompt generated basic but accurate visuals, while the detailed prompt significantly enhanced realism, environment quality, and motion coherence. Tools like Imagen Video and Make-A-Video showed strong performance when aligned with their strengths.

### **Result:**

Thus, the experiment effectively explored the difference between simple and detailed prompting techniques. It confirmed that prompt specificity directly influences the quality, coherence, and creativity of AI-generated video content.
